# DIIS
aka _diffraction image integration software_

This is the new home of DIIS, a cross platform program designed to quickly, but accurately convert a 2d x-ray diffraction image into a quantitative digital diffractogram.

# Build Requirements

I haven't touched this code in several years. Back when I was working on it, it appears I was using Qt 4.7.4 and Qwt 5.2.2. There is nothing too fancy about it though, so I imagine getting it to work with modern versions of Qt and Qwt would be fairly easy.

# Installation

A precompiled Windows binary is available from: http://www.japetrus.net/diis/DIIS.zip.

# Known problems
